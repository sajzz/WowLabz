Started learning of python for machine learning including various topics like Lists , Dictionary , tuple.
libraries like Numpy , Pandas , SciktLearn , which has inbuilt function for the implementation of the model required to analysis the data and find the conclusion
I am still learning the python concepts related to programming
Data Wrangling which is also called data cleaning is the important step to be done inorder to make our analysis easier
this includes:-
    1)Finding missing values and filling them or ignoring them as required
    2)Removing duplicate or irrelevant values
    3)Fixing the data having same meaning but differently written.
    4)bringing the dataset into similar scale to make analysis easier
    5)assigning the proper values to attributes eg. M=0 , F=1 for gender column

Supervised Learning , where we have labelled dataset and we need to train our model so that we can predict the result when we give our machine the test data
learned two algo 1) Linear regression 2) Logistics Regression 3)non linear

Unsupervised Learning , where dataset is not labelled and the model itself classify among the data and makes cluster out of it
algo learned 1) K- means 2)hierarchal - i)AGNES ii) DINES

...Continuing to learn new things..................
